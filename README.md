Keylogger GUI

 Overview:
This Python application implements a Keylogger with a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` for the UI components and `pynput` for capturing keyboard events. The Keylogger records keystrokes and displays them in real-time on the GUI. It allows users to start and stop logging, clear logs, and save logs to a specified file.

Features
Start Logging: Begins capturing keystrokes and displays them in the text area.
Stop Logging: Pauses the logging process.
Clear Logs: Clears all recorded keystrokes from the text area.
Choose File: Allows users to specify a file to save the logged keystrokes.
Real-time Display: Logs keystrokes in real-time, visible on the GUI.
Status Indicator: Indicates whether logging is currently active.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the application.
tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit.
pynput: Library used for monitoring and controlling input devices in Python.


 Future Enhancements
Encryption: Implement encryption for saved logs to enhance security.
UI Improvements: Enhance the look and feel of the GUI for better user experience.
Keylogging Statistics: Add features to display statistics such as key frequency and usage patterns.
Platform Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across different operating systems.
